# The official website from GitHub of me! 
# Created in partnership with Computing for All, a non-profit organization, by Bao Duy Nguyen under the Seattle Youth Employment Program's Summer Internship Program.

# The website is very easy to use. It has videos and other links, too!
# Some HTML and CSS codes come from the W3 Schools website, which is very helpful if you need to go over some techniques. You can learn more at www.w3schools.com!


# UPDATE 1 (as of July 18th, 2025)
# Some major changes are coming to this website! These include the addition to the Wonderful World of Windows website (hopefully it will work), and the navigation bar!
