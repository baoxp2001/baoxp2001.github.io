The official website from GitHub of me! 

Created in partnership with Computing for All, a non-profit organization, by Bao Duy Nguyen under the Seattle Youth Employment Program's Summer Internship Program.

The website is easy to use. It has videos and other links, too!
Some HTML and CSS codes come from the W3 Schools website, which is very helpful if you need to go over some techniques. You can learn more at www.w3schools.com!

Additionally, Bootstrap has a very good documentation for resources.

# UPDATE 1 (as of July 18th, 2025)
Some major changes are coming to this website! These include the addition to the Wonderful World of Windows website (hopefully it will work), and the navigation bar!

# UPDATE 2 (as of July 25th, 2025)
Another major changes are coming! These include Bootstrap's navigation bar,
carousel for slideshows, etc.

# UPDATE 3 (as of July 30th, 2025)
New updates include a background image of a green hill in the blue sky,
improved cards from Bootstrap, text color change for better readibility (hopefully),
added link to the Microsoft Camp Trip (coming soon!),
and a title change for the "windows.html" file from "The Wonderful World of Windows"
to "The Best of Windows".

# UPDATE 4 (as of August 1st, 2025)
It's the first month of August, and that means more major updates!
These include a carousel with slideshows of the Microsoft tour in August 2024 (more on that later), as well as fixes to the technical skills portion that has some bullets not ordered
or aligned properly, the completion of "The Best of Windows" site with the addition
to Windows 10 and 11, and fixed margins in the navigation bar.

To soft-launch the Microsoft Camp Blog webpage, a carousel featuring photos of the Microsoft Headquarters tour from the Youth At Work program, under the Seattle Parks and Recreations department, dated August 9th, 2024, has been added. This page will be updated beginning August 18th (or as soon as possible) with how Bao did so far during the camp to finish the SYEP (Seattle Youth Employment Program) Summer Internship program strong (unless things have changed)!

# UPDATE 5 (as of August 8th, 2025)
Another update includes a full launch of "The Journey of the Microsoft Camp" webpage, starting
with a prologue to the story. This website will be updated on a daily basis based on a chapter of a day. Also in that page, we have more pictures in the carousel, bringing a total of 25 pictures instead of the initial 20.

# UPDATE 6 (as of August 12th, 2025)
New updates include adding green color to the container for easy readability. In the "Windows" page, more Windows versions have been added, such as versions 1.01 up to 3.x (including NT). In the home page, the "TechZone" website has been added under the "Projects" section.

# UPDATE 7 (as of August 15th, 2025)
New updates include fixes to some texts/buttons not aligned properly with the margin,
fixes to the "h6" tag from the Microsoft Camp page, and remove dashes for the Windows 3.x button links from the Windows page. Additionally, for easy readability, a transparent green color container has been added.
