The official website from GitHub of me! 

Created in partnership with Computing for All, a non-profit organization, by Bao Duy Nguyen under the Seattle Youth Employment Program's Summer Internship Program.

The website is very easy to use. It has videos and other links, too!
Some HTML and CSS codes come from the W3 Schools website, which is very helpful if you need to go over some techniques. You can learn more at www.w3schools.com!

Additionally, Bootstrap has a very good documentation for resources.
