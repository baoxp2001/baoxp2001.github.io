            <p>
                Hello, everyone! I'm Bao Duy Nguyen (he/him/his). I am a current college
                student at <a class="no-padding" href="https://www.washington.edu/">the University of Washington - Seattle Campus</a> 
                and <strong>I have been falling in love with computers that much!</strong>

                <br></br>

                Born in <a class="no-padding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%E1%BA%BF"> Hue, Vietnam</a> 
                in December 17th, 2004 but grew up in <a class="no-padding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle">Seattle, Washington</a> 
                for over 2 decades since the mid-2000s, I have found a passion in computers since
                I first played around when I was an infant. From there, when I was an elementary school student,
                I learned how to type things around to make my life easier to manage while going smooth as it can be.
                Then, as a middle school student, I was landed at the technlology classroom to master some projects
                with Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, Scratch, Python, and video editing. When I transitioned to
                the high school era, I learned to code with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Unity, followed by the App Labs and Java.
                I took a year gap when I was a senior in my last high school year to take Biology 100 for the full year, as well as
                a student's library assistance for the fall semester. Going to the University of Washington Seattle Campus
                after graduating high school in the summer of 2023 felt like a dream to me because it was the campus that I 
                have been wanting to go to since the school took us there for some field trips, and it is in the best interest
                that I have adored so much. From Fall 2024 to Spring 2025, I finally took CSE 12x Introductory Courses
                to learn more about Java, and I am glad to say that it brings me back to my computer science journey.

                <br></br>

                I have been utilizing resources at UW to help me succeed for the academic journey. These include 
                <a class="no-padding" href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/msc/">The Math Study Center,</a> 
                <a class="no-padding" href="https://depts.washington.edu/ic/wordpress/">The OMA&D Instructional Center,</a>
                and <a class="no-padding" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/ta/ipl.php">The Introductory Programming Lab.</a>
                These resources have helped me pass, and I'm pretty sure you will, too!

                <br></br>

                I have been an intern for a non-profit organization named 
                <a class="no-padding" href="https://www.computingforall.org/">Computing For All</a> that can help me
                set up JavaScript and build this personal website this summer under
                <a class="no-padding" href="https://www.seattle.gov/human-services/services-and-programs/youth-and-young-adults/seattle-youth-employment-program"> the Seattle Youth Employment Program.</a>
                It is very fun to code with <a class="no-padding" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> and I have been enjoying it that much!!!

                <br></br>

                Outside of working and studying, I have enjoyed spending my time with my friends and family,
                going out to shop, and watching <a class="no-padding" href="https://www.wheeloffortune.com">Wheel of Fortune</a>,
                weeknights at 7pm on <a class="no-padding" href="https://komonews.com">KOMO TV-4</a>, streaming this fall
                on Hulu and Peacock!

                            that is named after that company, and that is called "The Wrigley Park," which is

        <h2 id="windows-xp-story">The Windows XP Story!</h2>

        <p>
            I have to admit... <strong>I have adored <a class="no-padding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP</a> that much!!!</strong>
            Windows XP is my childhood operating system that I have owned for years. When I was an infant,
            my family and I moved to the United States in the mid-2000s to start our new lives. Then, we owned our first
            computer, which was the eMachines desktop computer running Windows XP Home Edition. My father
            would come to me and play along with a computer together. I was so obsessed with Windows XP that I used Windows
            Media Player to watch DVD movies, followed by watching YouTube videos using 
            <a class="no-padding" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> (I know, I loved
            Internet Explorer that much). The Windows XP Tour was also fire; it has some music
            that matches with the features and some soothing narrations that I have loved it so much.

            <br></br>
            From then on, I used the Acer Aspire Revo Nettop in the late-2000s,
            which also came with Windows XP Home Edition. I continued to use XP until I upgraded to the Acer Aspire
            laptop running Windows 7. From time to time, I have upgraded to the new devices running Windows 8,
            then Windows 10, and now Windows 11. I'm currently using Microsoft Surface Pro, 11th Edition running
            Windows 11 to do some tasks, but now I've revived the Windows XP nostalgia by installing XP on my old
            Acer Aspire laptop. I use this secondary machine to play videos, sample music, and edit videos
            with Windows Movie Maker. It's time to experience the best, experience Windows XP!

            <br></br>
            And if you're wondering where I got Windows XP, it was at <a class="no-padding" href="https://www.repc.com/">REPC</a> in
            the Seattle area. REPC operates two locations: one in Seattle, and the other
            in Tukwilla. A copy of Windows XP Professional costs around $25, and I performed a fresh install
            on my old Acer Aspire laptop so that it wouldn't have too much bloatware. The only software that I managed
            to install was the Microsoft Office 2000 Premium Suite, which is surprisingly compatible with XP.
            You can also buy your own copy of Windows XP, as well as computers running XP, on eBay
            (and I recommend selecting "Free Shipping" as one of your options!).

        <h2 id="my-videos">Videos that have me on it!</h2>
        <p>
            When I was in high school, I was involved in our high school-run news program
            called Vantage Point (where we see you!). From 2021-22, I was a host of
            SQUAA! Sports, bringing viewers our famous sporting activities. From 2022-23, I was
            an anchor for Outside the Nest, where I brought students national, international, and local news
            outside of school. At our personal website, we do
            different better, and I am proud to show you some of the best moments here in this
            website. Take a look around!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are unable to watch one of the videos here, it is due to
            some limitations YouTube is currently having. I am aware of that and will
            investigate this as soon as I can. In the meantime, try clicking on a link that says,
            "Watch on YouTube,"
            and it will direct you to the YouTube page.
        </p>

        <p>
            UPDATE: It appears that with the url that you're on right now,
            which is <a class="no-padding" href="https://baoxp2001.github.io">https://baoxp2001.github.io</a>, all
            Vantage Point videos from YouTube have been working!!! I looked at the Live Server demo
            through Microsoft Visual Studio Code and I found the reason why some videos cannot be
            loaded here (directing you to watch on YouTube instead). Looking from the url, which is
            <a class="no-padding" href="https://baoxp2001.github.io">https://baoxp2001.github.io</a>, can help fix
            this issue! LOL
