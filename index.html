    <p>
        Hello, everyone! I'm Bao Duy Nguyen (he/him/his). I am a current college
        student at <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington - Seattle Campus</a> 
        and <strong>I have been falling in love with computers that much!</strong>
        <br></br>

        I have been an intern for a non-profit organization named 
        <a href="https://www.computingforall.org/">Computing For All</a> that can help me
        set up JavaScript and build this personal website this summer under
        <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/human-services/services-and-programs/youth-and-young-adults/seattle-youth-employment-program"> the Seattle Youth Employment Program.</a>
        It is very fun to code with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> and I have been enjoying it that much!!!

        <br></br>
        Outside of working and studying, I have enjoyed spending my time with my friends and family,
        going out to shop, and watching <a href="https://www.wheeloffortune.com">Wheel of Fortune</a>,
        weeknights at 7pm on <a href="https://komonews.com">KOMO TV-4</a>, streaming this fall
        on Hulu and Peacock!

        <br></br>
        Here's me at the Winter 2025's Research Symposium at the HUB!

            When I was a high school student, I made apps through code.org. These projects come
            from AP Computer Science Principles with Ms. Meredith Blache at
            <a href="https://clevelandhs.seattleschools.org">Cleveland STEM High School</a>.
