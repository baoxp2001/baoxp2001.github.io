                <p>
                    Never once in a while would I have a chance to go to Microsoft
                    during my internship. Microsoft has been a dream company that
                    I have been dreaming of since middle school (or maybe elementary school?)
                    because I was so obsessed with using computers, a lot of teachers that I know
                    in the Seattle area would immediately tell that a computer is like a gateway
                    to the whole wide world. 
                    
                    <br></br>

                    Moving to the Seattle, Washington, from Hue, Vietnam, between 2005 and 2006
                    when I was an infant brought me and my family a whole new experience.
                    We owned one of our very first personal computer after moving in,
                    which was an eMachines desktop computer running Windows XP Home Edition.
                    My father used that machine to read the news or do some work, but he would
                    also allow me to use the computer together. I felt like I was obsessed with
                    computers already. Later, I began watching funny videos on YouTube from Internet Explorer,
                    playing around with the "Windows XP Tour" bundled with its operating system, and so much more.
                    Later, my father bought his very first laptop that came with Windows Vista Home Premium. I was
                    fascinated with its famous Windows Aero, as well as watching YouTube videos (again on Internet Explorer),
                    seeing the so-called "Internet TV" that brings us together without having to use a TV tuner,
                    and so much more. As year goes by, so are the computers. From Windows 7 to Windows 8, to Windows 8.1 to
                    Windows 10, and now to Windows 11 and beyond, we all have a long lasting relationship with computers like
                    anything that we have imagined.

                    <br></br>

                    I was a summer day camp co-counselor intern at the Rainier Beach Community Center
                    under the "Youth At Work" program from Seattle Parks and Recreations, in partnership
                    with the Associated Recreation Council, on Mondays-Thursdays, between the months of July and August 2024. 
                    Under that program, I worked with the children,
                    encouraging them to participate in various activities such as going on field trips,
                    playing outside, etc., as well as listening to the children's requests and providing
                    support they needed to help improve their behaviors. I would always make several
                    callbacks to ensure that kids pay attention to their expectations and announcements, such as
                    "Macaroni and Cheese - Everybody freeze!", "Rainier... Beach!", "Waterfall, Waterfall! Shhhhh!",
                    and "Hocus Pocus - Everybody focus!"

                    <br></br>

                    
                    On August 9th, 2024,
                    the entire interns, including me, went to the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, Washington,
                    on a Professional Development Friday. Our first activity was a talk event where staff
                    at Microsoft discussed their experience coming to the company to work on software/hardware.
                    It was fascinating to share some of them with us, from college to landing a job at Microsoft,
                    that I would be considering doing the same thing as the others.

                    <br></br>

                    For our next activity, Microsoft took us to the Inclusive Tech Lab, where
                    Bryce was there to show us some inclusive accessories that are suitable for
                    accessibility, such as the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Microsoft Surface Adaptive Kit,
                    etc. Additionally, there are more to explore, such as the Type Cover for Surface that
                    enlarges the sizes for letters and numbers, and the giant digital whiteboard called
                    Surface Hub, where I found out that I could draw anything that I could have imagined. 

                    <br></br>

                    Preceeding the activity, they took us to lunch. Well, they served sandwiches
                    and cookies and cans of Jones Cola. But what I did not know was that Microsoft
                    offers all kinds of soft drinks... for free! So, I stepped outside to grab
                    a can of Coke.

                    <br></br>

                    Our third activity after lunch was to generate images with AI. For this activity,
                    <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/" class="no-padding" target="_blank">Microsoft Copilot</a>
                    would be used to generate whatever we want (and you can do so, too for free!).
                    A staff played a commercial for Copilot, then it was time for one of us to generate something.
                    The first person decided to generate a person sitting on a bench at the SeaTac
                    International Airport. The second person decided to make a strong, yet grizzly brown
                    bear who would be up and ready to fight in the forest. As for the third person, I generated
                    a person sitting on a chair, using Windows XP, on a background called "Bliss."
                    The fourth person decided to generate an image of a woman going to the University of Washington.
                    Then, the fifth person decided to generate an image of a woman going to Washington, D.C.
                    And finally, a group decided to generate "a 3D illustration of a classic style animated 4 young
                    diverse students playing soccer in front of a bank." It was fun trying to be creative, yet
                    we have to use AI responsibly!

                    <br></br>

                    And last but not least, our final activity took us to the Microsoft Visitor Center,
                    where a staff there showed us some Microsoft products throughout its history for over 50 years
                    in the making. Products that Microsoft launched include the first Microsoft Office suite in 1983,
                    the Microsoft Surface PixelSense table, Xbox Gaming Center, a collection of Windows 95,
                    and so much more. It definitely felt like we are starting ourselves up again!

                    <br></br>
                    And now, we're flashing forward to the year 2025. During my summer break, I was a
                    software web development intern at Computing For All under the Seattle Youth
                    Employment Program. I have been coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all throughout
                    my summer. And, beginning the week of August 18th, I, along with around 20-40 people in
                    the Computing for All program, will be on a trip to the Microsoft Summer Camp in Redmond, Washington!
                </p>

                <h2>What I'm looking forward to for the summer camp?</h2>
                <p>
                    Technically speaking, everything!!! I can't wait to see anything that
                    Microsoft has to offer. I have heard that there is going to be
                    some STEM workshops covering various subjects through Microsoft MakeCode,
                    learn about resume building and interview skills, and explore the Microsoft
                    Campus Expereinces! There is a transportation provided located at The State Hotel
                    in downtown Seattle, and that is going to be a shuttle bus provided by Microsoft.
                    I've heard that free Wi-Fi would be offered, so I'm not sure if that is true since
                    I haven't been on that Microsoft Shuttle Bus before, so if this is true, it is going to be
                    amazing!!!

                    <br></br>

                    UPDATE (as of August 11th, 2025): I'm being told that
                    the shuttle bus from Microsoft 
                    will not have free Wi-Fi, but I don't need to bring anything (just bring myself
                    and a bottled water, and a phone to take photos!). I would also need an Orca Card
                    to ride my way to Symphony Station (used to be called University Street but it has been
                    renamed to avoid confusion between this and the University of Washington campus).
                </p>
                

                <h2 id="august-eighteen">Chapter 1: Monday, August 18th, 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    Here we go!!! Into my first day of my Microsoft journey I go!
                    To get to my pick-up location, I use an Orca card to ride a
                    link light rail from <a class="no-padding" href="https://www.soundtransit.org" target="_blank">SoundTransit</a> 
                    to go to Westlake station (used to be called "University Street" but has been renamed to avoid
                    confusion between this and the University of Washington campus) from the Othello station. Then, I walk all the way
                    from Westlake to
                    <a href="https://www.statehotel.com/" target="_blank" class="no-padding">The State Hotel</a> 
                    near Pike for a shuttle bus pick-up to ride all the way to Microsoft!

                    <br></br>

                    As a matter of fact, the shuttle bus will leave The State Hotel at 9:15 AM because I know there is going
                    to be traffic from there to the Microsoft campus in Redmond, so I have to use my time well!

                    <br></br>

                    Upon arrival at the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Washington, I was received a badge that
                    is good thru this Friday, August 22nd. Then, when we entered a room, we were immediately given
                    free goodies (a Microsoft tote bag, a Microsoft hat, and a Microsoft-branded reusable water bottle)!
                    An introduction from Pius Gonzalvo was given, followed by a tour of the Microsoft Visitor Center downstairs,
                    showing us a history of its company, its mission, and its value. I didn't even know Microsoft has the
                    "Give" program, where they donate to a charity of their choice. The prototype version of Xbox looked very good,
                    but trust me, it was heavy since it was made out of aluminum. We were given an opportunity to explore around the center,
                    including Xbox games and a visit to the Microsoft Company store, which sells Surface-branded computers, Xbox systems,
                    and merch!

                    <br></br>

                    Following a tour was a trivia. I managed to answer two questions right (the answers were the "Give" program
                    when asked about the type of a charitable program the company is offering, and the year 2001 when asked
                    about the year date for the first Xbox, which was the same year as Windows XP). Then, we were given a T-shirt,
                    which was followed immediately by lunchtime. I got some orange peel chicken served with cucumber-and-tomato salad
                    and rice, and it was delicious. Then, I went to grab a drink because at Microsoft, if you work there, you can
                    get free drinks (I'm not gonna lie, the drinks are <strong>FREE!</strong>). So, I first grabbed a can of Talking Rain
                    sparkling water flavored with lemon-lime and was thinking of getting another one when we had our break time later
                    in our schedule.

                    <br></br>

                    After lunch, we were given a guest speaker with Cesar V. Martinez who came to Microsoft from
                    the Chicagoland area. It was fascinating to see how there are tons of flavors regarding the program managers,
                    including the technical program manager. Towards the end of the speaker event, I asked him this question,
                    "What was your first obsession with your computers? Because you did mention that you would do
                    literally anything with computers." He answered with his fact that his first time using a computer was
                    when he was in 2nd grade, and he was obsessed with Microsoft PowerPoint because of its animations and
                    transitions. Once he has been doing anything with his computers, it was the reason why he went for computer science
                    at his college. When the talk event ended, I immediately went to use a restroom, then on a way back to the room
                    for the next activity, I grabbed a can of Diet Coke and a cup with two lemon wedges.


                    <br></br>

                    Finally, to end our first day here at Microsoft, we had our lightning round of talks from
                    the networkers who work at Microsoft. I realized that there is a diversity of people from all
                    around the world coming to Microsoft; some who were originally from high school came to Microsoft
                    as Discovery interns; others who came to Microsoft thought that the company was their dream, and it definitely was.
                    It was a lot of fun talking to networkers, and I can't wait to see them again when I land at Microsoft in the near future.


                    <br></br>

                    And that concludes Chapter 1!

                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2 id="august-nineteen">Chapter 2: Tuesday, August 19th, 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    Ahh... what an interesting day! We began Day 2 with a lecture
                    from Mr. Alex via Microsoft Teams on tips and tricks about
                    resumes and LinkedIn. It was cool to hear from him. I was able to
                    ask a question on whether we should add some references, and the
                    answer was definitely a yes. I also heard about the process of
                    the referral; they would review their resumes and LinkedIn to see
                    if someone would be a great fit for a job they are looking for. That was
                    also cool to hear it behind the scenes. Then, for lunch, it was Taco Tuesday,
                    and I had my first plate that was so full, I had to get a second plate for some
                    servings of califlower barbacoa, and both plates were delicious!

                    <br></br>

                    Later in the afternoon, after lunch, we were supposed to take a tour of the
                    East Campus of Microsoft... but unfortunately, a protest has their own plans
                    (but I don't want to further explain it anyway because I'm not going to
                    talk about politics; this website is designed to keep track of what we did
                    so far that makes us feel happy and joy), so we ended up going back to
                    the Visitor Center to change our plans by engaging in a resume building workshop.
                    I also found Microsoft Copilot to be very useful because it uses its inspiration
                    to improve our resume, which I did! We participated in a resume building workshop
                    until it was time for us to go home.


                    <br></br>

                    And that completes Chapter 3. The next chapter involves the Microsoft MakeCode Day,
                    and it is going to be fun!
