                Never once in a while would I have a chance to go to Microsoft
                during my internship. Microsoft has been a dream company that
                I have been dreaming of since middle school (or maybe elementary school?)
                because I was so obsessed with using computers, a lot of teachers that I know
                in the Seattle area would immediately tell that a computer is like a gateway
                to the whole wide world. 
                
                <br></br>

                Moving to the Seattle, Washington, from Hue, Vietnam, between 2005 and 2006
                when I was an infant brought me and my family a whole new experience.
                We owned one of our very first personal computer after moving in,
                which was an eMachines desktop computer running Windows XP Home Edition.
                My father used that machine to read the news or do some work, but he would
                also allow me to use the computer together. I felt like I was obsessed with
                computers already. Later, I began watching funny videos on YouTube from Internet Explorer,
                playing around with the "Windows XP Tour" bundled with its operating system, and so much more.
                Later, my father bought his very first laptop that came with Windows Vista Home Premium. I was
                fascinated with its famous Windows Aero, as well as watching YouTube videos (again on Internet Explorer),
                seeing the so-called "Internet TV" that brings us together without having to use a TV tuner,
                and so much more. As year goes by, so are the computers. From Windows 7 to Windows 8, to Windows 8.1 to
                Windows 10, and now to Windows 11 and beyond, we all have a long lasting relationship with computers like
                anything that we have imagined.

                <br></br>

                I was a summer day camp co-counselor intern at the Rainier Beach Community Center
                under the "Youth At Work" program from Seattle Parks and Recreations, in partnership
                with the Associated Recreation Council, on Mondays-Thursdays, between the months of July and August 2024. 
                Under that program, I worked with the children,
                encouraging them to participate in various activities such as going on field trips,
                playing outside, etc., as well as listening to the children's requests and providing
                support they needed to help improve their behaviors. I would always make several
                callbacks to ensure that kids pay attention to their expectations and announcements, such as
                "Macaroni and Cheese - Everybody freeze!", "Rainier... Beach!", "Waterfall, Waterfall! Shhhhh!",
                and "Hocus Pocus - Everybody focus!"

                <br></br>

                
                On August 9th, 2024,
                the entire interns, including me, went to the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, Washington,
                on a Professional Development Friday. Our first activity was a talk event where staff
                at Microsoft discussed their experience coming to the company to work on software/hardware.
                It was fascinating to share some of them with us, from college to landing a job at Microsoft,
                that I would be considering doing the same thing as the others.

                <br></br>

            


                For our next activity, Microsoft took us to the Inclusive Tech Lab, where
                Bryce was there to show us some inclusive accessories that are suitable for
                accessibility, such as the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Microsoft Surface Adaptive Kit,
                etc. Additionally, there are more to explore, such as the Type Cover for Surface that
                enlarges the sizes for letters and numbers, and the giant digital whiteboard called
                Surface Hub, where I found out that I could draw anything that I could have imagined. 

                <br></br>

                Preceeding the activity, they took us to lunch. Well, they served sandwiches
                and cookies and cans of Jones Cola. But what I did not know was that Microsoft
                offers all kinds of soft drinks... for free! So, I stepped outside to grab
                a can of Coke.


                <br></br>

                Our third activity after lunch was to generate images with AI. For this activity,
                <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/" class="no-padding">Microsoft Copilot</a>
                would be used to generate whatever we want (and you can do so, too for free!).
                A staff played a commercial for Copilot, then it was time for one of us to generate something.
                The first person decided to generate a person sitting on a bench at the SeaTac
                International Airport. The second person decided to make a strong, yet grizzly brown
                bear who would be up and ready to fight in the forest. As for the third person, I generated
                a person sitting on a chair, using Windows XP, on a background called "Bliss."
                The fourth person decided to generate an image of a woman going to the University of Washington.
                Then, the fifth person decided to generate an image of a woman going to Washington, D.C.
                And finally, a group decided to generate "a 3D illustration of a classic style animated 4 young
                diverse students playing soccer in front of a bank." It was fun trying to be creative, yet
                we have to use AI responsibly!


                
                <br></br>

                And last but not least, our final activity took us to the Microsoft Visitor Center,
                where a staff there showed us some Microsoft products throughout its history for over 50 years
                in the making. Products that Microsoft launched include the first Microsoft Office suite in 1983,
                the Microsoft Surface PixelSense table, Xbox Gaming Center, a collection of Windows 95,
                and so much more. It definitely felt like we are starting ourselves up again!

                <br></br>
                And now, we're flashing forward to the year 2025. During my summer break, I was a
                software web development intern at Computing For All under the Seattle Youth
                Employment Program. I have been coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all throughout
                my summer. And, beginning the week of August 18th, I, along with around 20-40 people in
                the Computing for All program, will be on a trip to the Microsoft Summer Camp in Redmond, Washington!
            </p>

            <h2>What I'm looking forward to for the summer camp?</h2>
            <p>
                Technically speaking, everything!!! I can't wait to see anything that
                Microsoft has to offer. I have heard that there is going to be
                some STEM workshops covering various subjects through Microsoft MakeCode,
                learn about resume building and interview skills, and explore the Microsoft
                Campus Expereinces! There is a transportation provided located at The State Hotel
                in downtown Seattle, and that is going to be a shuttle bus provided by Microsoft.
                I've heard that free Wi-Fi would be offered, so I'm not sure if that is true since
                I haven't been on that Microsoft Shuttle Bus before, so if this is true, it is going to be
                amazing!!!
