                Windows NT technology.
                It provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support for better connectivity. The Start menu has
                been revamped, now showing frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and
                so much more. The "Switch Users" feature allows computer users to switch to the other user
                without having to close all applications and log out.
