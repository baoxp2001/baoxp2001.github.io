                Windows XP is the most popular operating system created by Microsoft. Launched on
                October 25th, 2001, XP unites both business and home users thanks to the power of
                Windows NT technology.
                It provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support for better connectivity. The Start menu has
                been revamped, now showing frequently used applications, recently opened documents, and
                so much more. The "Switch Users" feature allows computer users to switch to the other user
                without having to close all applications and log out.

            </h2>

            <p>
                Windows 8 is another major release from Microsoft that was made
                available on October 26th, 2012. Major changes to this operating system
                include replacing the traditional start menu with the so-called "Start" screen.
                The "Start" screen is optimized for touchscreen PCs, but it was criticized for
                making it confused to use, especially when it comes to keyboard and mouse. Another key feature
                found in this operating system is the revamped lock screen, now showing a background picture
                and a clock with the date on the left-corner of the screen; upon clicking the screen, swiping,
                or pressing a space bar, the secondary screen shows you the account(s) that may prompt you to
                enter your PIN number, your password, or even the picture password, which allows users to
                swipe anything that is in the picture to log in.
            </p>

            <p>
                An update to Windows 8, named Windows 8.1, was released almost one year after the release of Windows 8.
                It addresses many concerns and criticisms found in Windows 8 by bringing back the visible start button. 
                Another further update, called the April 2014 Windows 8.1 Update, brings keyboard and mouse closer together
                by showing the desktop by default when mouse is in use, as well as adding the search button and the shutdown
                options to the "Start" screen.
