            </h2>

            <p>
                Windows 8 is another major release from Microsoft that was made
                available on October 26th, 2012. Major changes to this operating system
                include replacing the traditional start menu with the so-called "Start" screen.
                The "Start" screen is optimized for touchscreen PCs, but it was criticized for
                making it confused to use, especially when it comes to keyboard and mouse. Another key feature
                found in this operating system is the revamped lock screen, now showing a background picture
                and a clock with the date on the left-corner of the screen; upon clicking the screen, swiping,
                or pressing a space bar, the secondary screen shows you the account(s) that may prompt you to
                enter your PIN number, your password, or even the picture password, which allows users to
                swipe anything that is in the picture to log in.
            </p>

            <p>
                An update to Windows 8, named Windows 8.1, was released almost one year after the release of Windows 8.
                It addresses many concerns and criticisms found in Windows 8 by bringing back the visible start button. 
                Another further update, called the Windows 8.1 April 2014 Update, brings keyboard and mouse closer together
                by showing the desktop by default when mouse is in use, as well as adding the search button and the shutdown
                options to the "Start" screen.

                One of the successful versions of Windows, Windows 10 was launched
                by Microsoft in July 29th, 2015. One of the major features found in Windows 10
                involves the return of the Start menu; this time, it combines both the familiarity
                of Windows 7 and the modern design of Windows 8 together in one.

                for favorites, downloads, and history, Reading View, and Cortana integration. A personal
                assistant, Cortana, was built into a search bar and allowed users to check the weather,
                news, or even tell her a story. Another well-known feature is the Task View, which lets users
                to quickly open the window and switch to the other window, all across the monitors
                or the virtual desktops.

                launched on October 5th, 2021. Windows 11 brings out a fresh, clean look
                and feeling. The taskbar is now center-aligned, and so is the redesigned Start
                menu, featuring pinned apps and recommentations powered by the cloud.
                Additionally, a set of new sounds has been implemented, and multi-tasking has
                now become a lot easier, thanks to the Snap Group and Snap Layout features.
                Microsoft Edge has now been powered by Chromium with less resources, while
                providing new features such as theme customizations, sleeping tabs, group tabs,
                and more.
